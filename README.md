## Assignments

### **Assignment 2: Weather**
- **Objective**: Create a notebook to plot temperature over time (`dryBulbTemperature_Celsius`).
- **Key Steps**:
  - Load the CSV file using `pandas`.
  - Convert `reportStartDateTime` to `datetime` format.
  - Create scatter and line plots of temperature over time.

### **Assignment 3: Domains**
- **Objective**: Analyze and visualize email domains using a pie chart.
- **Key Steps**:
  - Load the dataset into a `pandas` DataFrame.
  - Extract email domains by splitting the `Email` column.
  - Count the frequency of each domain using `value_counts()`.
  - Plot a pie chart showing domain distribution with labels and percentages.

### **Assignment 5: Risk**
- **Objective**: Simulate 1000 Risk battle rounds (3 attackers vs. 2 defenders) and visualize the results.
- **Key Steps**:
  - Simulate battles using dice rolls to determine troop losses.
  - Plot the outcomes of 1000 battles in a bar chart (attacker wins, defender wins, ties).
  - For advanced marks, simulate full battles until one side is eliminated, and plot troop counts over time.

### **Assignment 6: Knock Airport Weather**
- **Objective**: Analyze weather data from Knock Airport and create visualizations.
- **Key Steps**:
  - Load and preprocess the dataset from the provided link.
  - Plot temperature trends over time, including daily and monthly means.
  - Analyze windspeed data:
    - Plot rolling windspeed (24-hour period).
    - Plot daily maximum and monthly mean of daily maximum windspeed.
  - Handle missing windspeed data using forward-fill.
